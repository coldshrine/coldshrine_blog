1. From a data engineer's perspective, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances model performance by retrieving only the most relevant data before generating a response. This makes the process faster and more efficient, especially with large datasets.

An example from Reading Wikipedia to Answer Open-Domain Questions (Chen et al., 2017) shows how a model retrieves five relevant Wikipedia pages for a query, using that information to generate a better answer.

For engineers, RAG means building systems that can quickly retrieve key data, allowing models to handle large-scale information more effectively while improving accuracy and managing computational resources.
